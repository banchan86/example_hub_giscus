# Getting Started

This is a website to test the [giscus](https://github.com/giscus/giscus) commenting system for the Bonsai Example Hub. The nice thing about `Giscus` is that it uses `GitHub Discussions` as a base to serve comments and reactions, which:

- Is compatible with static-site hosts like `GitHub Pages` and solves the problem of us having to implement a separate comment/reaction framework that might require us building a dynamic web app.
- Relies on `GitHub` to sign in and is perhaps more privacy focused as compared to an alternative commenting system like [Disqus](https://disqus.com/).

I am only using `docfx` here as a website base, more than likely we would need to move to another framework that is better suited for a project hub type website. Best viewed on `Dark Mode`.

This page acts as a control test case to show that giscus can be enabled only for workflow submissions and not other pages.

The other pages map out different scenarios/solutions for using `giscus` which unfortunately does come with one major disadvantage related to app permissions.
