# New Workflow

This page tests `readonly giscus` on a new page with no existing comments/discussions. As you can see this might be a problem with the `readonly` approach, as there is no way to make a new comment/discussion. This can be solved later by adding a GitHub redirect and by seeding new workflow pages with a starter comment/reaction.
