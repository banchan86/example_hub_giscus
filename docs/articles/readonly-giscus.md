# Test Workflow

This page disables the new comment box, the reply box, and the reaction menu icon that allows you to select new reactions. This removes all the entry points for `giscus` login, and in effect puts it into `readonly` mode. We can then add a redirect for people to sign on to GitHub to leave comments/reactions.
