This page enables giscus in its default configuration. Notice the permissions needed to grant access to post comments and reactions. 
Giscus uses the title of the document (the first H1 element here) to match with a discussion. If a discussion is not found,
it can make a new discussion, and embeds a SHA-1 hash to match with it in the future.
